Agent: HTTP Client

name: sizes
type: distribution 
help: The distribution of the data request. The default is a constant request of 1000bytes             

name: servers 
type: list 
help: A list of available HTTP servers. A server is choosen randomly from the list (inherits from trafficclient)                    

name: interval 
type: distribution 
help: The distribution of the time lapse between two requests. Default is one second. (inherits from trafficclient)

name: useSocks
type: boolean
help: If true use tsocks to send the request. Note that this agent assumes tsocks is installed on configured on the machine.


Distributions Currently Available in MAGI  
(provides the python/lib/random.py module that implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions) 

minmax(min,max): Returns a value unformaly distributed between min and max 
pareto(alpha [,scale] [,cap]): returns a value from the pareto distrubtion. If scale is specified, the value is scaled by factor scale
                               If cap is specified, it returns a maximum of cap.   
gamma(alpha,rate [,cap]): Returns a value from the gamma distribution. 
			  If cap is specified, it returns cap if the value is greater than cap   
expo(lambda [,scale] [,cap]): Returns a value from an exponential distribution. if scale is specified, the value us scale by the factor scale 
                              If cap is specified, it returns a maximum of cap.
